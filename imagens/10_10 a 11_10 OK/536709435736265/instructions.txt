# How to use these files

1. Double-click the .zip file to extract it. Depending on your operating system, the .zip file may be automatically extracted, or you may be asked to extract the file to a specific location. Specifically, on Windows machines, ensure that the ZIP has been unpacked / extracted before proceeding. If you have trouble opening or extracting .zip files, please consult with your technical assistance unit.
2. Double click on records.html to open the HTML file. This should open up in your default browser. Google Chrome is the recommended browser.
3. The records.html file is split into two parts:
The menu, which is pinned to the left side of your screen.
The records, which will be central in your screen.
4. The menu contains hyperlinks to each category in the record. Clicking on them will automatically scroll to where they are in the document.
5. The menu also contains various print options. The "All" box will print all the content of the record. If you just want to print a certain category or categories, you can select the associated box(es). You can also print by page number, either a range or specific number.
6. Links to additional records, for example if a preservation was attached, are available under the "Links to Records" section.


# FAQs

* It looks like media is missing / I see weird icons where I believe there should be images or videos.
If you are on a Windows machine, you likely have not correctly unzipped the provided file. On newer Window operating systems, this involves right clicking the output, and clicking Extract. You should then interact with the html file in the extracted folder, not the ZIP. We encourage you to consult with your technical assistance unit if you continue to have issues.

* How can we use this?
You can use archive format records in the same way you would use PDF records. In some cases, records in the archive format may be more easily parsable by machine algorithms used by some agencies.

* What is the "linked_media" file?
The "linked_media" file stores all the non text parts of the record.  However, the records.html file includes the links to this data along with the relevant context.  Accordingly, we discourage interacting with the "linked_media" folder directly to avoid confusion, and encourage you to view all aspects of the record, including media, via the records.html file.

* What are hashes?
A hash is a unique alphanumeric combination assigned to each set of records produced by WhatsApp. By comparing the hash associated with your records to the matching hash in our internal systems, WhatsApp can authenticate that the records were indeed produced by us.

* I would prefer to work with the record in PDF format. How can I do that?
If you prefer to work with a PDF, you can convert the record by using your browser print options.

1. In the print menu, check the "All" box.
2. Click Print.
3. In the new window, use the browsers built in print tool to save the file to a PDF.

If you need assistance downloading or working with zip files, please contact your technical assistance unit.
